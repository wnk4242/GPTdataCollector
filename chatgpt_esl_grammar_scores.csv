The sentence is clear and effectively communicates the intended meaning without any errors that affect its flow or understanding."
ChatGPT,ChatGPT1,1,2,10,The students has finished their project.,3,"The sentence has a noticeable grammatical error in subject-verb agreement. 'Students' is plural, but 'has' is the singular form of the verb. The correct verb form should be 'have' to agree with the plural subject. This error may cause some confusion about the intended meaning, which affects the overall clarity and naturalness of the sentence. However, the context is still relatively understandable, which is why it does not fall to a lower score."
ChatGPT,ChatGPT1,1,3,8,The cat is sleeping on the sofa.,5,"The sentence ""The cat is sleeping on the sofa."" is grammatically flawless. It has a clear subject (""The cat""), a correctly formed verb phrase (""is sleeping""), and a prepositional phrase that accurately indicates location (""on the sofa""). The structure is simple and effective, conveying the intended meaning without any errors. Hence, it deserves a score of 5."
ChatGPT,ChatGPT1,1,4,5,We enjoys cooking dinner together.,2,"The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error; ""We"" is a plural subject, so the verb should be ""enjoy"" instead of ""enjoys."" This mistake makes the sentence difficult to read naturally and could hinder comprehension, leading to a score of 2. While the meaning is still somewhat clear, the grammatical error reduces the overall clarity and impact of the sentence."
ChatGPT,ChatGPT1,1,5,9,She don't know the answer.,1,"The sentence ""She don't know the answer."" contains a major grammatical error in the use of ""don't"" instead of ""doesn't.""

This error severely impairs the clarity and naturalness of the sentence, justifying a low score."
ChatGPT,ChatGPT1,1,6,7,Yesterday I am walk to the park.,2,"The sentence contains a significant grammatical error where ""am"" is incorrectly used in conjunction with ""walk"" instead of ""was walking."" This affects the clarity of the sentence, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning. Additionally, the absence of ""to"" as part of a correct continuous tense construction further complicates the sentence. While the general idea is still understandable (the speaker intended to express an action that occurred yesterday), the errors create confusion, warranting the score of 2."
ChatGPT,ChatGPT1,1,7,4,He has went to the store yesterday.,2,"The sentence contains a significant grammatical error with the verb tense. ""Has went"" is incorrect; the proper form should be ""has gone.""

These errors hinder the clarity of the sentence, making it somewhat difficult to understand the intended meaning. Hence, I rated it a 2."
ChatGPT,ChatGPT1,1,8,6,My brother plays the piano very well.,5,"The sentence ""My brother plays the piano very well."" is grammatically flawless.

There are no issues that affect clarity or flow."
ChatGPT,ChatGPT1,1,9,2,She like to play soccer on weekends.,3,"The sentence contains a noticeable grammatical error in the verb form. The subject ""She"" requires the verb to be conjugated correctly, so it should be ""She likes"" instead of ""She like.""

ChatGPT,ChatGPT1,1,10,1,I goes to school every day.,2,"The sentence contains a noticeable grammatical error with the verb ""goes,"" which should be ""go"" to match the subject ""I."" This error makes the sentence awkward and affects its naturalness, leading to some confusion about the intended meaning. Although the overall message is still understandable, the incorrect verb form is a significant flaw that contributes to a lower score."
ChatGPT,ChatGPT2,2,1,8,The cat is sleeping on the sofa.,5,"The sentence ""The cat is sleeping on the sofa."" is grammatically flawless. It follows standard English sentence structure, with a clear subject (""The cat""), verb (""is sleeping""), and prepositional phrase indicating location (""on the sofa"").

ChatGPT,ChatGPT2,2,2,9,She don't know the answer.,3,"The sentence ""She don't know the answer."" contains a noticeable grammatical error with the verb form ""don't"" used instead of ""doesn't.""

ChatGPT,ChatGPT2,2,3,7,Yesterday I am walk to the park.,2,"The sentence ""Yesterday I am walk to the park."" contains multiple grammar errors. The use of ""am"" is incorrect as it suggests continuous action in the present tense, while ""yesterday"" indicates a past action. The correct form should be ""I walked"" instead of ""I am walk."" Additionally, ""walk"" should be in the past tense. These errors make the sentence difficult to understand, particularly for someone unfamiliar with the intended meaning, but the context still allows for some level of comprehension. Overall, the frequency and severity of the errors warrant a score of 2."
ChatGPT,ChatGPT2,2,4,2,She like to play soccer on weekends.,3,"The sentence contains a noticeable grammatical error with the verb ""like,"" which should be ""likes"" to agree with the singular subject ""She.""

ChatGPT,ChatGPT2,2,5,4,He has went to the store yesterday.,2,"The sentence ""He has went to the store yesterday."" contains a significant grammatical error in verb tense. The correct form should be ""has gone"" instead of ""has went."" Additionally, the use of ""yesterday"" in combination with the present perfect tense (""has"") creates a temporal inconsistency, as the present perfect is typically used for actions that are relevant to the present or have unspecified time frames. These issues make the sentence difficult to comprehend and disrupt the natural flow of the writing."
